Specifying the parent link fieldÂ¶
As mentioned, Django will automatically create a OneToOneField
linking your child class back to any non-abstract parent models.
If you want to control the name of the attribute linking back to
the parent, you can create your own OneToOneField and set 
parent_link=True to indicate that your field is the link back to
the parent class.
